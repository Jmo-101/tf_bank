# Purpose

## Purpose
This project showcases the use of Terraform to create two instances within a VPC in two different availability zones and subnets. With the use of Git commands in the command line, I was able to upload it to a GitHub repository and link it to a Jenkins pipeline in order to build, test, and deploy the application.
